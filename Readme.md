# Deploying Hierarchical Models

This repository contains the code for deploying the pretrained hierarchical models on the 
various devices. The repo is divided into 2 folders:
- Library
- HomeDeployment
-
The Library holds a python module which we wrote for making deployment easier. The 
library contains 2 submodules, 'communicate' and 'loadMode'.
